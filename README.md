This repository demonstrates a common error in Dockerfiles where the CMD instruction, when used to start a Python HTTP server, fails to execute correctly. The original Dockerfile uses `CMD ["python3", "-m", "http.server", "8000"]`. This approach can fail because the current working directory isn't properly set.  The solution involves using an ENTRYPOINT to ensure that the working directory is set before running the CMD command. This makes the Docker image more robust and less prone to errors.
